# Code for ROBOT and MERWE

This repository contains the code (in Python and R) needed to replicate the results of the working paper 
Theoretical and computational aspects of robust optimal transportation, with applications to statistics and machine learning. The working paper version 
of the manuscript is available on arXiv.


Specifically:

1- the folder MERWE[https://github.com/dvdlvc/Robust-optimal-transportation/tree/main/MERWE] contains the R files needed to reproduce the reuslts in \S 5.3 of the paper (minimum robust Wasserstein estimation);
2- the folder
