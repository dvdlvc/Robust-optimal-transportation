# Code for ROBOT and MERWE

This repository contains the code (in Python and R) needed to replicate the results of the working paper 
*Theoretical and computational aspects of robust optimal transportation, with applications to statistics and machine learning*, by Ma, Liu and La Vecchia. The working paper version of the manuscript is available on arXiv.


Specifically:

1. the folder [MERWE](https://github.com/dvdlvc/Robust-optimal-transportation/tree/main/MERWE) contains the R files needed to reproduce the results in \S 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 of the paper (minimum robust Wasserstein estimation);

2. the folder [RWGAN](https://github.com/dvdlvc/Robust-optimal-transportation/tree/main/RWGAN) contains the Python files needed to reproduce the results in \S 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 of the paper (Robust Wasserstein GAN). The availanle code is for both sythetic and real data (see .zip folder);

3. the folder [Robust domain adaptation] contains the Python files needed to reproduce the results in Appendix of the paper (Robust domain adaptation via ROBOT).
