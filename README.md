# Code for ROBOT and MERWE

This repository contains the code (in Python and R) needed to replicate the results of the working paper 
*``Theoretical and computational aspects of robust optimal transportation, with applications to statistics and machine learning''*, by Y. Ma, H. Liu and D. La Vecchia. Both Y. Ma and H. Liu are affilited to the University of Science and Technology of China, while D. La Vecchia is at the University of Geneva. The working paper version of the manuscript is available on arXiv.


Specifically:

1. the folder [MERWE](https://github.com/dvdlvc/Robust-optimal-transportation/tree/main/MERWE) contains the R files needed to reproduce the results in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 of the paper (minimum robust Wasserstein estimation);

2. the folder [RWGAN](https://github.com/dvdlvc/Robust-optimal-transportation/tree/main/RWGAN) contains the Python files needed to reproduce the results in Section 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 of the paper (Robust Wasserstein GAN). The availanle code is for both sythetic and real data (see .zip folder);

3. the folder [Robust domain adaptation](https://github.com/dvdlvc/Robust-optimal-transportation/tree/main/Robust_domain_adatation) contains the Python files needed to reproduce the results in Appendix of the paper for the Machine Learning problem: Domain Adaptation via ROBOT.

4. the folder [ROBOT_estimation_oulierdetection](https://github.com/dvdlvc/Robust-optimal-transportation/tree/main/ROBOT_estimation_oulierdetection) contains the Python files needed to reproduce the results in Appendix of the paper in which the Authors illustrate how to use ROBOT to detect outliers first and then to estimate the model parameters via OLS in a regression problem.
